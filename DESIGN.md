# DESIGN!!!

## How does the game work?

A level is made of solid lines.

Each player is piloting a Mechalicious â€” Mech for short.

There are team spawn points scattered around the outskirts of the map.

There's a core in the center. It is the primary reservoir of the resources you collect from the map. It is defended by a giant boss monster. If you defeat the boss monster, the core can be captured. If you capture the core, you *rapidly* get all the remaining resources in the core.

There are various resource nodes scattered around the map. They can be captured. A captured resource node will slowly transfer resources from the core to the owning team. Some nodes are defended by minibosses and are more valuable, most nodes are not defended and are less valuable.

You cannot lose without dying. You can normally respawn by spending resources. If you do not own a spawn point, or you do not have enough resources to spawn, losing is possible. If everyone on your team is dead and can't respawn, You Lose!!!

If you own a node big enough to support a miniboss, you can build a miniboss. 

At your base(s), there are buttons that you can use to spend accumulated resources to purchase different attack units that will path to a nearby enemy resource node and attack/capture that node. These units are the only way to capture nodes. Different units are different somehow.

# PVE mode

In PVE mode, you get resources at the beginning of every wave based on how many nodes you own, and resources are theoretically infinite. The core is your spawn. The core boss is your friend. Wave after wave of troops come after you. You lose if your core gets uncaptured, even if you're alive. (This can go on forever. This is a feature.)
